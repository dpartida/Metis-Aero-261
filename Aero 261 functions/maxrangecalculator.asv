function [v_BR,d_BR] = maxrangecalculator(W,S,p,K,C)
%This function calculates the velocity for best range and distance traveled
%   It does this by using the equation provided in class and relies on the
%   varibles W(weight), S(wing area), p(air density), K 
%       Calculated in m/s
v_BR = sqrt(((2*(W/S))/p)*sqrt((3*K)/(C_D0))); %calculated in m/s
d_BR = v_BR*(3600/1000)*t; %converts v_BR into km/h and calculates distance in km
